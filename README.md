### Task 1

To design the basic calculator, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to design the basic structure of the calculator. CSS styles are used to apply styles on the calculator and JavaScript is used to add the calculation functionality.

### Task 2

A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this article, we are creating a tribute webpage of the first computer programmer Ada Lovelace using HTML and CSS. We will add an image of him at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. Inside that box, we will write a few of his achievements and details. We will use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS, we will align and beautify the design. 

### Task 3
The To Do List uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a "to-do list" to organize and prioritize your tasks.
